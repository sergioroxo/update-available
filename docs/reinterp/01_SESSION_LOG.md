# REINTERP SESSION LOG — append-only; newest at the top of DONE

## NEXT UP
**Session 3 — R2 (the pillow: "Somatic Reprocessing", Era 2)**. Spec:
`docs/CODEX_PROMPT_REINTERP_R0_R2_2026-07-02.md`, Session R2 + draft copy in
`Pc_Simulation/Sources/Deep Research/Provotypes for a SOGICE VR documentary.md`. Build ON the R1 framework
(`data/provotypes/pillow.json` + `src/desktop/apps/provotype.ts` — the runtime already round-trips). All
copy PLACEHOLDER (`_doc: "PLACEHOLDER — Sérgio voice pass + G6 ethics gate pending"`); restrained low-poly
click-confirm animation (no swing satisfaction, design law §R2-2); failure shape = silence; Cohen
dossier-only; provenance omits the unverified "until deeper feelings emerge" phrase. Note for R2: the
framework currently treats every choice button as a single confirm→response advance (no per-choice
branching) — enough for the pillow's Lift/Exhale/Strike + Repeat/Finish, but confirm before relying on it.

## BLOCKED / WAITING
- Pillow copy voice pass (Sérgio) — build proceeds with PLACEHOLDER; final copy lands whenever ready.
- G6 ethics/religious-trauma read of the pillow — Sérgio scheduling.
- In-headset playtest date (A11 gate) — gates ALL spatial sessions.
- R7 build spec — Fable writes it after R2 ships.

## DONE
*(2026-07-02 · Session 2 — R1 provotype framework. Built the one reusable grammar as a data-driven
runtime `src/desktop/apps/provotype.ts`: diegetic assistant INVITATION → ≤2-sentence FRAME → interactive
VIGNETTE (click states: prompt → choose → system response + optional bare `felt` line) → dossier-grade
DEBRIEF (provenance body + `sources[]`, each with `status: documentary|contested|speculative` + a
PLAYER-VISIBLE `confidence` label + `[VERIFY SOURCE]`). Laws honored: Leave + Pause live from frame one at
a fixed position every phase; click/tap only; NO score/streak/timer/progress-counter (no "n/total"); felt
lines rendered bare; both completion AND abandonment filed to the in-memory ledger (`ledger.provotypes[]`,
new field) with the witness/cold side gaining one line each (copy resolved from the provotype data, not
composed in TS). Rendered with Era-1 theme tokens (only theme in code today; comment notes multi-era
selection later). Schema `data/provotypes/_schema.json` extended to document invitation/frame/states/
debrief/ledgerTags/witness while keeping `cuts` + `failure` + `register`. Dummy round-trip
`data/provotypes/_dummy.json` (PLACEHOLDER, `_`-prefixed = non-content). Reinterp-only launcher wired into
`DesktopOS` (icon + modal routing + onClose), all behind `this.reinterp`. Framework chrome strings in
`data/strings/reinterp.json`; one witness heading in `slice.json` (guarded). Verification: `npm test` +
`npm run build` green (pre-existing Vite chunk-size warning only); FULL round-trip driven in the browser at
`?flat=1&reinterp=1` — invitation (Helpy) → frame → 3 states (choice → response + felt → Next) → debrief
(3 color-coded statuses + confidence + [VERIFY SOURCE]) → Close → flip to witness showing CLASSIFICATION
`provotype:dummy` + ASSIGNED SESSIONS "session: completed · outcome: none"; screenshots captured at each
step. No-flag baseline `?flat=1`: no `data-reinterp` attr, no era-palette marker in any frame, console
clean (baseline desktop screenshot not captured — background-tab RAF throttling stalled the scripted BIOS
boot; launcher-absence + inert launcher-spot click + dormant witness proven instead by 44 headless
assertions run against the exact bundled source: full round-trip, Leave-abandonment filing, pause/resume,
OS launcher gating + click routing + onClose, and baseline non-regression). All copy PLACEHOLDER; no
ethics/creative calls made. → FABLE ROUND note: framework advances on ANY choice button (no per-choice
branching yet) — fine for the pillow, revisit if a later provotype needs divergent choices.)*

*(2026-07-02 · Session 1 — R0 flag + namespaces. Added the `?reinterp=1` mount flag through
`src/main.ts`, `src/flat/flat.ts`, `src/engine/app.ts`, and `src/desktop/os.ts`; added a tiny
era-palette canvas marker plus `data-reinterp="1"` only when the flag is present; created
`data/provotypes/_schema.json` and `data/panels/`. Verification: `npm test` passed; `npm run build`
passed with the existing Vite chunk-size warning; in-app Browser preview passed for `/?flat=1&reinterp=1`
(marker + data hook, Leave click works, no console errors), `/?flat=1` baseline (no marker hook, no
console errors), and `/` baseline (no marker hook, no console errors). No content/copy finalized.)*

*(2026-07-02 · Session 0 — worktree setup + doc sync. Created
`/Users/sergiogalvaoroxo/update-available-reinterp/` on branch `reinterp` from the committed shipped
baseline, copied the required reinterp doc set from the original folder, installed dependencies in the
worktree, and verified the copied doc inventory. Verification: `npm test` passed; `npm run build` passed
after rerunning with filesystem access for Vite's worktree writes; preview returned HTTP 200 for `/` and
`/?flat=1&reinterp=1`. No player-facing code/content changed.)*

*(2026-07-02 · system created — no build sessions run yet. Plan of record:
`docs/REINTERP_MASTER_PLAN_v1_2026-07-02.md` through Feedback Round 4.)*
